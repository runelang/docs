## A Taste of RuneLang

```rune
// define a hero
Guild Hero is
    Runestone name;
    Mutable Countstone health;
    Countstone attack;

    Ritual new(Runestone n, Countstone hp, Countstone atk) begins
        thy.name is n;
        thy.health is hp;
        thy.attack is atk;
    end of Ritual

    Ritual strike(Familiar target) begins
        Chant(thy.name + " strikes " + target.name + "!");
        target.health is written as target.health - thy.attack;
    end of Ritual
end of Guild

Familiar player is summon Hero("Thorin", 100, 30);
player.strike(enemy);
```

## Why RuneLang?

RuneLang was built for developers who want a language that's **fast**, **safe**, and **genuinely fun to write**. It takes the readability of Python, the expressiveness of JavaScript, wraps it in a fantasy-themed syntax, and compiles to bytecode with performance that rivals both.

**v0.1.0-pre performance**: Beats Node.js on loops, strings, collections, math, classes, error handling, and maps. Competitive with Python across all benchmarks.

Whether you're building a side project, teaching someone to code, or just want to write software that feels like casting spells — RuneLang is your weapon of choice.
